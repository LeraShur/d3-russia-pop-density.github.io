# d3-russia-pop-density.github.io
The Choropleth Map, designed using D3, conveys a general picture of population density across Russia in 2018. According to the result, distribution from the most populated areas to the least populated goes from European to the Asian part of the country. As this project is created in terms of Assignment 3 of Multimedia Cartography course, it is presented additionally as an interactive map that can help the user explore population density in more details and track the slightest changes across administrative divisions.
